# Dummy StatsD

This is a simple dummy StatsD server.

This is useful in that it lets you inspect the StatsD messages a system is sending and they are sent,
and without having to deal with the whole Graphite, etc setup.

You run this from the command line, and then can see raw StatsD messages coming in, as they are coming in.
